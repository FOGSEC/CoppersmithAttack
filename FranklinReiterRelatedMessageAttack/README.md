#Franklin-Reiter Related Message Attack
Franklin-Reiter identified a new attack against RSA with public exponent e=3. If two messages differ only by a known fixed difference between the two messages and are RSA encrypted under the same RSA modulus N, then it is possible to recover both of them.
*Not only e=3 is able to attack*
